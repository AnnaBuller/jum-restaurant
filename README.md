# JUM Restaurant website

Hello, glad to have you drop by here! This restaurant website is a project I created at the beginning of learning programming on my own. Ah, those days of being carefree about good practices! 💙😄

🔥 But this website is responsive! And on mobile you can show/hide the text in „Jak u mamy – czyli kim jesteśmy” section.
